# Mouse-CATching

It has been my first project created with the Pygame module. All the pixel graphics were self-made with the Krita Pixel Art app.

# Gameplay

The game is about defeating opponents (mice) and improving the main character (cat) by buying specific services or items in the store that spawns every 5 levels before each boss. The previously mentioned bosses appear also every 5 levels and each is 2 times stronger than the previous one. For killing an ordinary monster, we can get from 25 to 50 gold and a random number of points depending on the level of the player (the higher the level, the more points you can get killing a monster). For killing the boss, we get the same possible number of points as for killing an ordinary monster, but we get random bonuses amounting to about 50-125 times more than our current level added to the gold. The game ends after killing the final boss on level 30. In the game, we use letters - respectively: a (to go left) and d (to go right) and we attack with space.

# Additional information

This game is fully functional. You can download this repository and run the Python_Gra.py file. There might be a possibility that you could have some missing modules. After downloading the missing parts you should be able to run the game. If you don't want to run it on your own device - you can go into the screenshots directory to have a little insight of the game.
